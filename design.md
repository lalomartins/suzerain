# Suzerain design

## Requirements

requirements:

0. Web (play anywhere).

0. VASSAL package compatible.

0. A group installs it on their own server, and manages packages by just dropping them on a server directory.

0. Good enough on smartphones (app optional).

0. Persistent (real-time play isn't mandatory; if all players disconnect, the game stays there waiting).

0. Players are tied to server accounts. You don't have a password for each game, just an account on each server. Then there's a dashboard with the games you're in at the moment, the ability to create one, etc.

0. Notifications. (But what and how?)

non-requirements (for now at least):

- Package editing.

- User account management.

- Package management beyond install/uninstall on server.

- Scripting (groups can use Greasemonkey if they want).

open:

- How to create accounts? Can anyone just sign up for any server? Or does an admin have to create the account? If so, how? Web UI or text (or json, or yaml) file on server?

- Can any user join any game before it's started?
